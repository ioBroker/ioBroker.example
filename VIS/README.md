## template adapter for ioBroker

Template for adapter development

## Developer manual
This section is intended for the developer. It can be deleted later

### Getting started

You are almost done, only a few steps left:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub with the name `ioBroker.template`
1. Initialize the current folder as a new git repository:  
    ```bash
    git init -b main
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
1. Link your local repository with the one on GitHub:  
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Author/ioBroker.template
    ```

1. Push all files to the GitHub repo:  
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
1. Add a new secret under https://github.com/Author/ioBroker.template/settings/secrets. It must be named `AUTO_MERGE_TOKEN` and contain a personal access token with push access to the repository, e.g. yours. You can create a new token under https://github.com/settings/tokens.

1. Head over to [widgets/template.html](widgets/template.html) and start programming!

### Best Practices
We've collected some [best practices](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.repositories#development-and-coding-best-practices) regarding ioBroker development and coding in general. If you're new to ioBroker or Node.js, you should
check them out. If you're already experienced, you should also take a look at them - you might learn something new :)

### Scripts in `package.json`
Several npm scripts are predefined for your convenience. You can run them using `npm run <scriptname>`
| Script name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `test:package` | Ensures your `package.json` and `io-package.json` are valid. |
| `test` | Performs a minimal test run on package files. |
| `translate` | Translates texts in your adapter to all required languages, see [`@iobroker/adapter-dev`](https://github.com/ioBroker/adapter-dev#manage-translations) for more details. |
| `release` | Creates a new release, see [`@alcalzone/release-script`](https://github.com/AlCalzone/release-script#usage) for more details. |

### Publishing the widget
Using GitHub Actions, you can enable automatic releases on npm whenever you push a new git tag that matches the form 
`v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. We **strongly recommend** that you do. The necessary steps are described in `.github/workflows/test-and-release.yml`.

Since you installed the release script, you can create a new
release simply by calling:
```bash
npm run release
```
Additional command line options for the release script are explained in the
[release-script documentation](https://github.com/AlCalzone/release-script#command-line).

To get your widget released in ioBroker, please refer to the documentation 
of [ioBroker.repositories](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.repositories#requirements-for-adapter-to-get-added-to-the-latest-repository).

### Test the adapter manually on a local ioBroker installation
In order to install the adapter locally without publishing, the following steps are recommended:
1. Create a tarball from your dev directory:  
    ```bash
    npm pack
    ```
1. Upload the resulting file to your ioBroker host
1. Install it locally (The paths are different on Windows):
    ```bash
    cd /opt/iobroker
    npm i /path/to/tarball.tgz
    ```

For later updates, the above procedure is not necessary. Just do the following:
1. Overwrite the changed files in the adapter directory (`/opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.template`)
1. Execute `iobroker upload template` on the ioBroker host
