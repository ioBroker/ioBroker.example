# ioBroker.template
=================

This adapter is a template for the creation of an ioBroker adapter. You do not need it unless you plan on developing your own adapter.

It includes both code running within iobroker and as vis widget. If you only plan to create a vis widget then you should use the [iobroker.vis-template](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.vis-template) instead.

## Steps 
1. download and unpack this packet from github ```https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.template/archive/master.zip```
  or clone git repository ```git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.template.git```

2. download required npm packets. Write in ioBroker.template directory:

  ```npm install```
  
3. set name of this template. Call
  
  ```gulp rename --name mynewname --email email@mail.com --author "Author Name"```
  
  *mynewname* must be **lower** case and with no spaces.

  If gulp is not available, install gulp globally:
  
  ```npm install -g gulp-cli```
 
4. rename directory from *ioBroker.template* (can be *ioBroker.template-master*) to *iobroker.mynewname*

5. to use this template you should copy it into *.../iobroker/node_modules* directory and then create an instance for it with iobroker.admin

6. create your adapter:

  * you might want to start with main.js (code running within iobroker) and admin/index.html (the adapter settings page).

  * [Adapter-Development-Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker/wiki/Adapter-Development-Documentation),
  
  * [Installation, setup and first steps with an ioBroker Development Environment](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker/wiki/Installation,-setup-and-first-steps-with-an-ioBroker-Development-Environment)
  
  * [Write and debug vis widgets](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker/wiki/How-to-debug-vis-and-to-write-own-widget-set)
  
  * files under the www folders are made available under http://&lt;iobrokerIP&gt;:8082/&lt;adapter-name&gt;/
    * for this to work the iobroker.vis adapter has to be installed
    * delete this folder if you do not plan to export any files this way
    * call ```iobroker upload <adapter-name>``` after you change files in the www folder to get the new files uploaded to vis
  * the widget folder contains an example of a vis widget
    * you might want to start with *widget/<adapter-name>.html* and *widget/js/<adapter-name>.js*
    * call ```iobroker visdebug <adapter-name>``` to enable debugging and upload widget to "vis". (This works only from V0.7.15 of js-controller)
    * If you do not plan to export any widget then delete the whole widget folder and remove the ```"restartAdapters": ["vis"]``` statement from *io-package.json*
    * After admin/index.html is changed you must execute ```iobroker upload mynewname``` to see changes in admin console. The same is valid for any files in *admin* and *www* directory  

7. change version: edit package.json and then call ```grunt p``` in your adapter directory.
  
8. share it with the community

## Requirements
* your github repository must have name "ioBroker.<adaptername>". **B** is capital in "ioBroker", but in the package.json the *name* must be low case, because npm does not allow upper case letters.
* *title* in io-package.json (common) is simple short name of adapter in english. *titleLang* is object that consist short names in many languages. *Lang* ist not german LÃ¤nge, but english LANGuages.
* Do not use in the title the words "ioBroker" or "Adapter". It is clear anyway, that it is adapter for ioBroker.
